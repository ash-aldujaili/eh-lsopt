# The EmbeddedHunter Algorithm for Large-Scale Black-Box/Derivative-Free Optimization

This repository hosts the code for the `EmbeddedHunter` algorithm for large-scale black-box optimization proposed in the **Embedded Bandits for Large-Scale Black-Box Optimization** paper, which is accepted at the thirty-first AAAI conference on artificial intelligence ([http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2017/aaai17call.php AAAI-17]).
