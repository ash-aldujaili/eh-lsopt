With these files at hand, you can now compile `plot-table.tex` to create the pdf version of AAAI'17 paper's Figure 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Citation\r\n\r\nIf you write a scientific paper describing research that made use of this code, please consider citing the following paper:\r\n~~~\r\n@inproceedings{ash2017eh,\r\n  title={Embedded Bandits for Large-Scale Black-Box Optimization},\r\n  author={Abdullah Al-Dujaili and S.
